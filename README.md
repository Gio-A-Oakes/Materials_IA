Useful references for Cambridge Materials Science IA course

## Genral Materials Science refernces:

The first point of reference for any course are the handouts and the lectures themselves. However, some students might find a different explenation more intuativeon a particular topic, or might want to gain a deeper understanding on something that has been brushed over quickly. As a result, here I will try to compile some useful resources:
There are many interactive learning packages that have been created over the years at the Materials department present in [DoITPoMS](https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/).
A general textbook that covers most of the topics in first year materials can be found in *Callister, William D., and David G. Rethwisch. Materials science and engineering: an introduction. Vol. 9. New York: Wiley, 2018*.

## Course A: Atomic structures of materials:

This is an introductiory course into Crystallography, which is the study of how atoms are arranged into an ordered structure.
To help visualise some of these complex structures, the department has a license to Crystalmaker, which you can download ontp your computer (highly reccomended).
A useful database for theoretical and experimental data on materials' properties can be found in the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/), for which is free to make an account.
To get familiar with the different symmetries, all the 230 different space groups can be found [here](http://img.chem.ucl.ac.uk/sgp/mainmenu.htm).
I noticed that one of my previous lecturers has also decided to make a [GitHub page](https://github.com/aronwalsh/Crystallography) for his course that he is teaching this year on Crystallography. I don't know exactly what he will cover and how frequently he will update the page over the course of the term, but it might be useful, especially since he shows how to set up Crystallmaker.

## Course B: Materials for Devices:

This course covers a viarity of technologically relavent properties that certain types of materials have, such as magnetism, piezoelectricity, how batteries work etc.
A useful book that goes into more depth on most of the topics covered is *Moulson, Anthony J., and John M. Herbert. Electroceramics: materials, properties, applications. John Wiley & Sons, 2003*.

## Course C: Diffraction:

In this course, one of the most conceptually challenging topics covered is the idea of reciprical space, which unfortunatly cannot be mathematically understood without covering Fourier transforms, which is usually done in second year. 

## Course D: Microstructure:

A useful textbook that covers this course is [*Porter, David A., and Kenneth E. Easterling. Phase transformations in metals and alloys (revised reprint). CRC press, 2009.*](https://ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=1763501&site=ehost-live&scope=site).
Alternative lectures and lecture notes on this topic can be found [here](https://dyedavid.com/mse104/).

## Course E: Mechanical Behaviour of Materials:

A good reference on dislocations, can be found in [*Hull, Derek, and David J. Bacon. Introduction to dislocations. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2001.*
