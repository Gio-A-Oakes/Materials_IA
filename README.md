Useful references for Cambridge Materials Science IA course

## General Materials Science references:

The first point of reference for any course is the handouts and the lectures themselves. However, some students might find a different explanation more intuitive or might want to gain a deeper understanding of a particular topic. As a result, here I will try to compile some useful resources:
Many interactive learning packages have been created over the years at the Materials department present in [DoITPoMS](https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/).
A general textbook that covers most of the topics in first-year materials can be found in *Callister, William D., and David G. Rethwisch. Materials science and engineering: an introduction. Vol. 9. New York: Wiley, 2018*.

## Course A: Atomic structures of materials:

This is an introductory course into Crystallography, which is the study of how atoms are arranged into an ordered structure.
To help visualise some of these complex structures, the department has a license to CrystalMaker, which you can download onto your computer (highly recommended).
A useful database for theoretical and experimental data on materials' properties can be found in the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/), for which is free to make an account.
To get familiar with the different symmetries, all the 230 different space groups can be found [here](http://img.chem.ucl.ac.uk/sgp/mainmenu.htm).
I noticed that one of my previous lecturers has also decided to make a [GitHub page](https://github.com/aronwalsh/Crystallography) for his course that he is teaching this year on Crystallography. I don't know exactly what he will cover and how frequently he will update the page throughout the term, but it might be useful, especially since he shows how to set up CrystalMaker.

## Course B: Materials for Devices:

This course covers a variety of technologically relevant properties that certain types of materials have, such as magnetism, piezoelectricity, how batteries work etc.
A useful book that goes into more depth on most of the topics covered is *Moulson, Anthony J., and John M. Herbert. Electroceramics: materials, properties, applications. John Wiley & Sons, 2003*.

## Course C: Diffraction:

In this course, one of the most conceptually challenging topics covered is the idea of reciprocal space, which unfortunately cannot be mathematically understood without covering Fourier transforms, which is usually done in the second year. As such, I have created a Jupyter notebook that you can run on your browser that goes through some of these concepts, which you can find [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gio-A-Oakes/Materials_IA/blob/main/Jupyter_notebooks/Reciprical%20space.ipynb#scrollTo=lp80hNY4pkmA).

## Course D: Microstructure:

A useful textbook that covers this course is [*Porter, David A., and Kenneth E. Easterling. Phase transformations in metals and alloys (revised reprint). CRC Press, 2009.*](https://ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=1763501&site=ehost-live&scope=site).
Alternative lectures and lecture notes on this topic can be found [here](https://dyedavid.com/mse104/).

## Course E: Mechanical Behaviour of Materials:

A good reference on dislocations, can be found in [*Hull, Derek, and David J. Bacon. Introduction to dislocations. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2001.*
